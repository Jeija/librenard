`librenard` is a portable library written in the C programming language that implements [Sigfox](https://www.sigfox.com/) uplink and downlink frame encoding and decoding. It aims to be an open source replacement for [Sigfox's proprietary device library](https://build.sigfox.com/sigfox-library-for-devices). It can be used together with the CLI frontend [`renard`](https://github.com/Jeija/renard) and the SDR physical layer [`renard-phy`](https://github.com/Jeija/renard-phy) or be embedded in custom applications.

It has been tested on Linux, macOS and Android (x86 and ARM), but should also be portable to other operating systems and various microcontroller platforms.

## Installation and Compilation
* Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jeija/librenard
```

* `librenard` has no dependencies other than a working compiler and `make`. Compile using:
```
cd librenard
make
```

* This generates the static library file `librenard.a` which can be linked to your application or the `renard` CLI frontend.

## Embedding
`librenard` is designed to be statically linked with your own application, so that it can be embedded into microcontroller code or into other tools.
For using `librenard` you will have to tell your compiler about the path to the `librenard.a` static library file and about the path to the header includes.

Most compilers (shown here: `gcc`) use the following options to specify library and header locations:
```
gcc -I librenard/src <your_C_sources> librenard/librenard.a -o out
```

See [`renard`](https://github.com/Jeija/renard) for an example of how to incorporate `librenard` into your application and build system.
Please refer to the [documentation](#documentation) for information on how to include the `librenard` headers in your source code and for information on how to use the `librenard` functions.

## Documentation
Up-to-date documentation is always available online at [Read the Docs](https://librenard.readthedocs.io).

You can build the documentation yourself by following these steps:
* Clone the `librenard` if you have not already (see [Installation and Compilation](#installation-and-compilation))
* `librenard` uses [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org), [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) and [breathe](https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe) for documentation. You will need to install these dependencies.
* Generate HTML documentation files:
```
cd librenard/doc
make html
```
* Open `doc/_build/html/index.html` in a web browser
